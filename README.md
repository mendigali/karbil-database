# Introduction
As we all know, today the state program Digital Kazakhstan is being implemented, the purpose of which is to improve the quality of life of the population through the use of digital technologies. One of the areas of this program is the digitalization of education, in particular the digitalization of educational institutions. For this reason, I decide to choose this topic.
I decided to implement this global project locally, in the territory of my former school. So, the goal of my project is to create a database which will store information about school, its students, teachers and alumnees.
The Database Management System is practical because users can access it from various platforms at any time. Also, a digital database eliminates the need to store a huge amount of paper documentation, and more importantly, speeds up the processing of information at times.
